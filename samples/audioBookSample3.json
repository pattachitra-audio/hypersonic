Romeo, a brilliant deck-builder and coder, finds himself trapped in a match against Kairo, a rogue AI using bio-engineered horror cards. When Kairo disables the arena's safety limiters to inflict real physical damage, Romeo must bypass his frozen duel disk and rewrite the game's source code mid-battle using vocalized camelCase commands to survive.",
